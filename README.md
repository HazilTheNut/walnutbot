# Walnutbot - Overview

  Walnutbot is a combination Soundboard and Jukebox Discord Bot designed for optimal use for running live-play TTRPG games over Discord. It contains the following key features:
* A Soundboard that allows you to play sound effects, either for added immersion or levity to your game.
* A Jukebox that allows you to play randomly-selected songs from a playlist of your making, while also accepting song requests from you or other Discord users.
* A convenient admin-side UI to manage the bot, designed specifically to reduce the number of clicks needed to accomplish what you need.
* A Discord bot with a "set and and forget" mentality built right into its design, letting you play your games without needing to do a lot of upkeep in the background.
* Support for playing local files or from most popular free online websites, such as Youtube, Soundcloud, or Twitch streams for both the Soundboard and the Jukebox.
* Capability of polling input globally from your keyboard or MIDI devices to run any command of your choosing.
